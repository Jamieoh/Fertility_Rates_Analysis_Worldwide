## Introduction

Matt Ridley’s hypothesis states that "fertility rates everywhere will converge to 2.1 in a few decades, and the world population will stabilise at 9 billion people"
This is known as the replacement rate. When this rate is hit the population will begin to shrink. 

Our project uses compiled datasets of fertility rates, education and population growth using data collected from the World Bank and United Nations data sources. Our collective objective is to illustrates through appropriate visualisations the evidence that might support Matt Ridley’s hypothesis.
Our four main visualtions are as follows:

1. Percentage increase in world population from 1950 till present. 

2. Changing fertility rates from 1950 to the present for selected countries of the world.

3. Regional view of the above visualisation 

4. The observed relationship between fertility & per capita income & education

## Data Visualisation Techniques
- To execute these visualizations, we used R Studio. 
- To create the best visualizations, we utilized many different r packages such as; tidyverse; ggplot2; reshape; and dplyr.
- After exploring and creating the visualizations we then uploaded them to a HTML page rendered from a RMarkdown script. 

## Datasets Analysed
